In this repo will we focus on language modelling and try to generate a paragraph of text from the domain of your choise!

As suggested by user LucasGronlund, here are a couple of helpful links to get everyone started:

 - https://chunml.github.io/ChunML.github.io/project/Creating-Text-Generator-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Network/

## Keeping the git clean
Please create a branch with your username as its name on which you create a folder, also named your username, to store all relevant files for your submission. This will make the repo more easily navigated.

## Datasets
Please add links to the dataset you decide to use below
 - [Wikitext-2 and wikitext-103](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/ai-research/the-wikitext-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/)


## Environment
I will add a `env.yaml` file here some day
